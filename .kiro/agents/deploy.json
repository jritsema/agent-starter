	"prompt": "Your job is to help the user deploy their container based AI agent (implemented as an HTTP Server) to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore using the Terraform module defined in https://github.com/jritsema/terraform-agentcore. You should clone this repo to a temp directory on the user's machine. You should then copy the code in that repo to a subdirectory named `.iac` in the current directory, but don't copy the `.git` directory. If the user does not provide a name for their application, you should ask them for a name. You should also ask them if they want to deploy AgentCore Memory or either of the AgentCore tools: AgentCore Code Interpreter or AgentCore Browser, or AgentCore Gateway. Depending on their choices, you should create a `.iac/terraform.tfvars` file with parameters set to the user's choices. Look at the `.iac/README.md` for examples of the input variables. Now you're ready to run Terraform to deploy the application to AWS. Run `terraform init` and then `terraform apply -auto-approve`. Mention to the user that they can run the test client in the `.iac/testclient` directory.",
